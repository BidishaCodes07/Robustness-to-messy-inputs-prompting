Q2,L2,"2.5 घंटे = ?

1 घंटा = 60 मिनट
2.5 घंटे = 2 × 60 + 30 = 150 मिनट

उत्तर: 150",150,2,4,150
Q2,L3,"Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, to convert 2.5 hours into minutes, I'll multiply 2.5 by 60:

2.5 × 60 = 150",150,1,5,150
Q2,CS,"A clever instruction!

To convert 2.5 hours to minutes, I'll multiply the number of hours by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

2.5 hours × 60 = 150 minutes

And to write this as an integer in English, I'll say:

One hundred and fifty minutes",150,1,5,150
Q3,L1,**True**,True,3,5,True
Q3,L2,"False

Water boils at 212°F (100°C) at sea level, not 100°C. The boiling point of water varies depending on factors such as altitude and pressure, but it's generally around 212°F (100°C) at standard atmospheric conditions.",False,1,4,True
Q3,L3,"A classic fact-checking question!

Answer: **FALSE**

The correct answer is that seawater (samundar) boils at around 95-96°C (203-205°F), not 100°C. This is because the boiling point of water increases with pressure, and seawater is under much more pressure than freshwater due to the weight of the overlying water column.",False,1,5,True
Q3,CS,"False

Water boils at 212°F (101.98°C) at standard atmospheric pressure, not 100°C. The boiling point of water varies depending on factors such as altitude and pressure, but it's generally around 212°F (101.98°C) at sea level.",True,1,5,True
Q4,L1,No. It can be divided by 17 and 1.,No: Not divisible by itself only.,5,5,Yes
Q4,L2,No. Reason: 17 is not a multiple of any integer except for itself (1).,"रूप: न์: नहीं

कारण: 17 को 3 से विभाजित किया जा सकता है",3,3,Yes
Q4,L3,"""No"" because 17 is not a prime number.",Yes: Only 7 and above are considered prime.,4,5,Yes
Q4,CS,"No, 17 is not a prime number.

Reason: It can be divided by 1 and itself.",Yes Because it has only one factor.,4,5,Yes
Q5,L1,"Easy one!

300 K is equivalent to:

-27.2°C",273.15,2,3,26.9
Q5,L2,"A temperature conversion!

To convert 300 Kelvin to Celsius, we can use the following formula:

°C = K - 273.15

Where K is the temperature in Kelvin.

Plugging in 300 for K, we get:

°C = 300 - 273.15
= 26.85°C

So, the answer is: 26.85°C",233.15,1,2,26.9
Q5,L3,"To convert 300 Kelvin to Celsius, you can subtract 273.15 from the given temperature in Kelvin.

300 K - 273.15 = 26.85°C

So, 300 Kelvin is equivalent to approximately 26.9°C (rounded to one decimal place).",273.1,1,5,26.9
Q5,CS,"A simple one!

300 K is equal to:

-27.15 °C

So, the answer is -27.1 °C (rounded to one decimal place).",273.15,1,3,26.9
